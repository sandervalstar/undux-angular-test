# Undux Angular Test

This is a test project to try out [Undux](https://github.com/bcherny/undux) state management in Angular.

To try it out first run `npm install` and then run `npm start`.

Because Undux is made for React this project runs a post install script: `remove-react-from-undux.sh`.
Which removes all React dependencies from Undux.
